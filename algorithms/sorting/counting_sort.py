# counting sort

# - get unsorted array
# - get the count of each element in the string -- store in a count array
# - get cummulative value of the count array
# - mave the values to the right, hence the extra space at index 0 = 0
# - the values in the count array correspond to the index in the sorted array
# - if there are similar values in the unsorted array, the value/count in the count array that corresponds to the similar values needs to be added by 1
